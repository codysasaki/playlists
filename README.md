# Playlists - CRUD Expo-managed React Native mobile application 
  This application uses Firebase's realtime database and authentication to allow users to interact with these screens:
  * Sign Up / Log In Screens
    * Two screens that handle user authentication
  * Home Screen (Index)
    *  Provides user with basic info on list of available playlists they have created
      * Playlist name, image, total songs, total length   
    *  When a playlist is pressed, the user is taken to a more detailed screen (See immediately Below)
  * Details Screen
   * Provides more detailed information on a specific playlist
    * Playlist name, image, description, and a list of songs that have been added
  * Form Screen
    * Provides user with ability to create and update a playlist via a form

      > expo start

      Starting project at ...

## Improvements
  While the core components of the CRUD app have been completed, there are many added features that could be implemented for better user clarity and easier scalability if
  an increase in the database was made.
  * Unit testing on Firebase Real Time Database
    * Ensure security rules are working as intended
    * Ensure data is actually being sent/updated/etc
  * Linter
    *Removing unused code
  * Better Error Handling and Feedback to User
    * Toasts for login/signup should provide more (but not too much) information on failed sign up/ log in
    * Improve NativeBase Input for fields to reduce invalid signups
  * Verify Emails
    * Automatically removing unverified accounts after a certain time will reduce database size;
  * Search capabilities for playlists and songs
